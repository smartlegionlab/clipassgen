路 Rights to create and distribute proprietary modifications without the obligation to disclose source code.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES TO ALL USERS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY OPERATE UNDER THE NON-COMMERCIAL OR A COMMERCIAL LICENSE.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS (IF ANY) BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

GOVERNING LAW & GENERAL PROVISIONS

This licensing framework shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Russian Federation, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

By using this Software without a written commercial license agreement, you automatically agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of the Non-Commercial License (Option 1). Any use that does not comply with the terms of either license constitutes copyright infringement.

If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
