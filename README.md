## Description:

___clipassgen___ - Console Smart Passwords Generator.

> Smart passwords are not stored anywhere - they are generated on the fly. For a combination - login + secret phrase, or only using a secret phrase, 
> you will always receive the same password from 10 to 1000 characters.
> This is as safe as possible. Your passwords are not stored anywhere, they are generated on the fly when requested.

Possibilities:

- Generate smart passwords using the combination: login + secret phrase.
- Generate smart passwords using a secret phrase.
- Generate common complex passwords.

Smart Password generator (login + secret phrase):

Generates a recoverable smart password
linked to login or name and secret phrase.
To generate and restore, you need to remember
login and secret phrase.

Smart Password Generator (secret phrase):

Recoverable password generator.
The password will be linked to a secret phrase.
The password is not stored anywhere and is generated on the fly.
To generate or recover a password, you only 
need to remember the secret phrase.

Base Password Generator:

A common password generator.
When generated, the password will always be different.
It will be impossible to restore it.

***

> Console manager of smart passwords that are not stored anywhere and are generated on the fly. 
> Only the public key, login and password length are stored. 
> You store the smart password under the desired login or just a name, and when received, 
> enter the secret phrase and receive a generated smart password: [clipassman](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassman/).

> Passwords generated and saved in clipassman will be identical to passwords generated in clipassgen.


To create your own smart password generator apps, you can use the library: [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/).
