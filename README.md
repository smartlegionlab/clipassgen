## 🖥️ Console Smart Password Generator

A cross-platform command-line utility for generating smart password.

> **Powered by** [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib) - The core deterministic password generation library

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔒 **Zero Storage** - Passwords generated on-demand, never stored
- 🔄 **Deterministic Generation** - Same inputs always produce identical passwords
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android (Termux)
- ⚡ **Instant Generation** - Generate passwords directly from command line
- 🔐 **Multiple Modes** - Support for different generation strategies

Your passwords don't need to be stored because they were never created - they already exist as mathematical certainties, waiting to be discovered through the correct combination of login and secret phrase.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install clipassgen
```

For systems with package conflicts:
```bash
pip install clipassgen --break-system-packages
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
clipassgen
```

### Command-Line Options
```bash
# Generate smart password with login and secret phrase
clipassgen -l "your_login" -s "your_secret_phrase" -n 16

# Generate using only secret phrase
clipassgen -s "your_secret_phrase" -n 14

# Generate base password (random)
clipassgen -n 12
```

## 🎯 Generation Modes

### 1. Smart Password (Login + Secret Phrase)
```bash
clipassgen -l "alice@example.com" -s "mySecret123" -n 16
# Output: 'eTZj3ZOng8v$ql2v'
```

### 2. Smart Password (Secret Phrase Only)
```bash
clipassgen -s "myUniversalSecret" -n 14
# Output: 'U7_HbTbKdcsl2#'
```

### 3. Base Password (Random)
```bash
clipassgen -n 12
# Output: 'r4nD0m!P@ssw' (different each time)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Batch Generation
```bash
# Generate multiple passwords for different services
clipassgen -l "github" -s "main_secret" -n 20
clipassgen -l "email" -s "main_secret" -n 18
```

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation

### How It Works
- **Deterministic Algorithm**: Same inputs (login + secret) always produce identical output
- **Zero Storage**: No passwords are stored - everything is generated on-demand

### Recovery Process
Your passwords can always be regenerated using the same:
- Login/identifier
- Secret phrase
- Password length

## 🔄 Ecosystem Integration

### Complementary Tools
- [**CLI PassMan**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassman/) - Console password manager for smart passwords
- [**SmartPassLib**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/) - Core Python library for password generation
- [**Desktop Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager-desktop) - Graphical interface
- [**Web Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager) - Web-based interface

### Consistency Guarantee
Passwords generated with clipassgen are identical to those generated by other ecosystem tools when using the same inputs.

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **No Password Storage** - Eliminates risk of password database breaches
- **Local Generation** - All processing happens on your local machine
- **Deterministic Yet Secure** - Reproducible without being predictable

## 🤝 Supported Platforms

- **Linux** - All major distributions
- **Windows** - 7, 8, 10, 11
- **macOS** - Fully supported
- **Android** - Via Termux

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone and run manually
git clone https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassgen.git
cd clipassgen
python app.py
python app.py -n 10 -s "secret" -l "login"
```
