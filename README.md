## üñ•Ô∏è Console Smart Password Generator

A cross-platform command-line utility for generating cryptographically strong, recoverable smart passwords using deterministic cryptography. Part of the smart password ecosystem built on revolutionary password management principles.

> **Powered by** [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib) - The core deterministic password generation library

## üåü Key Features

- üîí **Zero Storage** - Passwords generated on-demand, never stored
- üîÑ **Deterministic Generation** - Same inputs always produce identical passwords
- üì± **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android (Termux)
- ‚ö° **Instant Generation** - Generate passwords directly from command line
- üîê **Multiple Modes** - Support for different generation strategies
- üéØ **Cryptographically Secure** - Uses SHA3-512 and system entropy

## üåå The Paradox at the Core

This tool embodies a beautiful cryptographic paradox: **perfect reproducibility meets complete unpredictability**. 

The system is both:
- **Perfectly reproducible** - Identical inputs (login + secret phrase) will always generate the exact same password, every time, on any device
- **Completely unpredictable** - Without the exact inputs, the output is computationally impossible to guess or reverse-engineer

This paradox is powered by deterministic cryptography - the same revolutionary concept explored in our foundational articles:
- [**The Password That Never Was**](https://dev.to/smartlegionlab/the-password-that-never-was-how-to-access-secrets-that-were-always-there-smart-password-library-4h16) - How passwords emerge from mathematical space rather than being created
- [**Chrono-Library Messenger**](https://dev.to/smartlegionlab/i-created-a-messenger-that-doesnt-send-any-data-heres-how-it-works-4ecp) - The cryptographic framework enabling this paradigm
- [**Messages That Have Always Been With Us**](https://dev.to/smartlegionlab/the-magic-of-messages-that-have-always-been-with-us-48gp) - Philosophical foundation of pre-existing information

Your passwords don't need to be stored because they were never created - they already exist as mathematical certainties, waiting to be discovered through the correct combination of login and secret phrase.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install clipassgen
```

For systems with package conflicts:
```bash
pip install clipassgen --break-system-packages
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
clipassgen
```

### Command-Line Options
```bash
# Generate smart password with login and secret phrase
clipassgen -l "your_login" -s "your_secret_phrase" -n 16

# Generate using only secret phrase
clipassgen -s "your_secret_phrase" -n 14

# Generate base password (random)
clipassgen -n 12
```

## üéØ Generation Modes

### 1. Smart Password (Login + Secret Phrase)
```bash
clipassgen -l "alice@example.com" -s "mySecret123" -n 16
# Output: 'xT8$kL9!pQ2sM3c@n'
```

### 2. Smart Password (Secret Phrase Only)
```bash
clipassgen -s "myUniversalSecret" -n 14
# Output: 'M3c@n1cL4mp$h4d'
```

### 3. Base Password (Random)
```bash
clipassgen -n 12
# Output: 'r4nD0m!P@ssw' (different each time)
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Batch Generation
```bash
# Generate multiple passwords for different services
clipassgen -l "github" -s "main_secret" -n 20
clipassgen -l "email" -s "main_secret" -n 18
clipassgen -l "banking" -s "main_secret" -n 22
```

### Integration with Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automate password generation in scripts
PASSWORD=$(clipassgen -l "$1" -s "$2" -n 16)
echo "Generated password: $PASSWORD"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Foundation

### How It Works
- **Deterministic Algorithm**: Same inputs (login + secret) always produce identical output
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Uses SHA3-512 for secure one-way generation
- **System Entropy**: Incorporates system randomness for additional security
- **Zero Storage**: No passwords are stored - everything is generated on-demand

### Recovery Process
Your passwords can always be regenerated using the same:
- Login/identifier
- Secret phrase
- Password length

## üîÑ Ecosystem Integration

### Complementary Tools
- [**CLI PassMan**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/clipassman/) - Console password manager for smart passwords
- [**SmartPassLib**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib/) - Core Python library for password generation
- [**Desktop Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager-desktop) - Graphical interface
- [**Web Manager**](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-password-manager) - Web-based interface

### Consistency Guarantee
Passwords generated with clipassgen are identical to those generated by other ecosystem tools when using the same inputs.
